# UltraMotion

This project consists of a research on promising techniques to segment bones on ultrasound images, specifically on femur and tibia. This is part of a project whose goal is to develop a non-invasive and non-irradiating motion capture system that compensate STA (Soft Tissue Artefact) and is adapted to clinical setting. It is done in collaboration with the University Hospitals of Geneva.

During this project, two mains segmentations techniques are researched. One using Deep Learning technique, based on this study and implementation:

 And another one using Local Phase Features and Dynamic Programming, based on this study:

 ## Current state

This project is currently in development, and its implementation is not guaranteed to work properly yet.
